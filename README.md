## Introduction
This is developed because i always have very messy download folder. I have compiled the code into a exe build so you can use it directly. I will not be releasing the code for this script.

## Instruction
1. Download the rar file
2. Extract the rar file
3. run the exe file to start
4. browse and select the folder you wish to organise
5. click OK and it should organise your files based on the file extension.
